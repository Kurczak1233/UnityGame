UnityGame is a simple music like game, which allows user to listen to music and remember patterns simultaneously.


Tech stack:
Figma
Unity
GitHub

General overview:
The main plan of the game consists of the stages on which the user have to click on the buttons rythmically.
We are mainly focused on creating some educational game with music elements which will play an important role in the whole project.
The pattern will be shown in advance beforehand the user turn. The buttons will be highlighted as the notes play.
The game should consists of at least few stages in order for us to educate more how to use unity, and for the user entertainement.
Every stage will be divided into sequences which user has to beat at least correctly to beat the enemy.

Story:
The game should include some simple story elements in order to introduce user into a specific mood.
In order for game to be educational and funny we want to introduce a hero called Janusz.
Janusz is a construction site worker who is working in Norway and is addicted to alcohol as the slavic tradition says.
At the beggining there will be an intro showing the Janusz who is drunk.
The hero will have to trick the supervisor who is assessing the current soberness of the Janusz that he is sober when in reality he is not.
There will be few supervisors, from the teams colleagues to the boss of the company who will be alerted about the situation.
Beating the game will result in no fines for the Janusz who is happy that he can continue his work and the slavic tradition.

Stages:
The stage will consists of multiple gray blocks. The blocks will be changing colours when the pattern shown by the boss will be activated.
There will be a few stages, for each stage there will be different enemy to trick. 
The effect can vary. For instance we plan to add some drunkeness effects which will imitate the state of the Janusz.
Other example may consists of speeding up or slowing down the pace, or some other graphical effects which could strenghten the visal impressions.
Every boss should have different effects.
After the intro the user will be shown a tutorial how to use the interface. 
There are plans to introduce some extra musical or graphical effects which could help or disturb the user in the game.

Gameplay:
The user will have to complete serveral patterns shown by the supervisor/boss. The user will have basic set of 3 lives (or more) per level.
Maximal amount of lives will give the user possibility to make some mistakes without losing the level progress.
  Sequences: 
  The main idea behind sequences is that there should be at least a few of them.
  After every sequence the user will have a few seconds break, and then the new pattern will be shown.
  At the beggining of each level the user will start with 3 lives. Hovever every mistake will cost in one life.
  The user may obtain some extra lives by catching the rythm appropriately, or jumping on blocks which may contain a heart.  
The user will have to jump on the blocks in the rythm, so he can keep up the pace.
Losing all lives results in being detected as a drunk.
