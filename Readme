UnityGame is a simple music like game, which allows user to listen to music and remember patterns simultaneously.


Tech stack:
Figma
Unity
GitHub

The main plan of the game consists of the stages on which the user have to click on the buttons rythmically.
The pattern will be shown in advance beforehand the user turns by a bot. The buttons will be highlighted as the notes play.
The goal of the game is to repeat all the patterns shown by a bot.
The limitations will constist of limited user reaction time and the corectness of the pattern.
